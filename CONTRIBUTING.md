### How To Contribute with PRs

The new companies must be added to the `/data` folder using a dedicated file in `snake_case.json` format.
Subsequently, the `README.md` file is automatically generated, so you don't have to edit it manually.

1. Open `./data` directory
2. Add a new JSON file for the new company (file name should be a slugified version of the company name)
3. File content should respect the following format:

```JSON
{
    "name": "CompanyName",
    "career_page_url": "https://companyname.companytld/jobs",
    "url": "https://www.companyname.companytld/",
    "remote_policy": "Full",
    "hiring_policy": "Contract",
    "type": "B2B",
    "category": "cloud_software",
